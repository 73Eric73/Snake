The classic Snake!
------------------
This is currently my latest project; a object-oriented Snake game implemented in Java.  
This Java project features a classic Snake game implemented using object-oriented programming. Users control the snake's movement with 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys to  navigate the game board. The goal is to eat food ('X') to grow the snake's length while avoiding collisions with the board edges. The console-based game provides an  interactive and enjoyable experience.
